## A repo for maintaining vagrant sandboxes for testing various scenarios. 
Please feel free to clone and use!


### Folder naming convention:
os\_\_num\_vms\_\_note

 * num\_vms is the number of provisioned VMs
 * note is a very short description in snake\_case
   * I'll try to have a README in directory as well
